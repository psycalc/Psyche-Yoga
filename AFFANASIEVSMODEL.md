## Afanasyev's Model for an IT Audience

Afanasyev's model, also known as Psychosophy or Psychoyoga, is a theory of personality that describes the relationship between an individual and the categories of time: Present, Past, Future, and Eternity. The model includes four functions: Physics, Logic, Will, and Emotion, which represent direct ways for a person to influence the world.

In Afanasyev's model, the first function is expressed excessively, the second normatively, the third inadequately, and the fourth insignificantly. This means that individuals may excel at integrating information from their primary psychosophic aspect (their first function), but may struggle with breaking down complex situations related to that aspect into smaller components or understanding its nuances.

The first function in Psychosophy is characterized as being the main support for each person. It is something static and immovable, from which "confidence in tomorrow" originates and on which a person always relies in their life. In addition to being a support, the first function is also characterized as being result-oriented, excessive, strong, rough, operating like a hammer, self-confident but at the same time cautious, and narcissistic.

For example, a programmer with a dominant first function in Logic may excel at integrating information from their primary psychosophic aspect (Logic) to create a cohesive understanding of programming problems or situations. However, they may struggle with breaking down complex programming problems into smaller components or understanding the nuances of each aspect.

I hope this description helps to explain Afanasyev's model in a way that is understandable for an IT audience.
