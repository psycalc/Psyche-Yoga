# Psyche-Yoga ([Tatctical level of human interaction or tactical compatibility](human_interactions.md))
Psychosophy, also known as "Psyche Yoga" or "PY," is a personality system created by Alexander Afanasyev. The structure of Psychosophy was first described in his book "Syntax of Love"ยน. The foundation of Psychosophy is a four-element model represented by a set of functions determined by unique combinations of their working properties. These functions are referred to by their ordinal number: First, Second, Third, and Fourth. The task of each function is to process one of the four psychosophic aspects: "Emotion," "Logic," "Will," and "Physics." Each aspect can only be processed by one function. Thus, the four aspects are distributed among all positions of the model. There are a total of twenty-four unique combinations of aspect distribution among functions, each representing its unique "psychosophic type" (or "PY-type").

The four psychosophic aspects in Psychosophy are "Emotion," "Logic," "Will," and "Physics." According to Afanasyev, these aspects describe the corresponding states of a person's "soul," "mind," "spirit," and "body," respectively. Psychosophy (as a psychological typology) studies the process of human interaction with each other by exchanging their aspectual states. The nature of such interaction is determined by the properties of the PY-type model functions, and its content is determined by the properties of the aspectual state perceived by the function. For example, through "emotion" we exchange emotions and feelings with our interlocutor, adjust or ignore others' feelings, share our experiences with others, demonstrate acting skills and natural self-expression, depend or not depend on our own experiences, and have the ability to empathize. 

In Psychosophy, the aspect of "Emotion" refers to interactions such as exchanging emotions with an interlocutor, adjusting or ignoring others' feelings, sharing one's own experiences with others, demonstrating acting skills and natural self-expression, depending or not depending on one's own experiences, and having the ability to empathize. The perception of the "Emotion" aspect is related to the exchange of emotions and feelings between individuals. 

In Psychosophy, the aspect of "Logic" refers to interactions such as exchanging opinions and representations with an interlocutor. The perception of the "Logic" aspect is related to the exchange of opinions and ideas between individuals.

In Psychosophy, the aspect of "Will" refers to interactions such as exchanging desires and goals with an interlocutor. The perception of the "Will" aspect is related to the exchange of desires and goals between individuals. Is there anything else you would like to know about this topic?

In Psychosophy, the aspect of "Physics" refers to interactions such as the realization of physical needs. The perception of the "Physics" aspect is related to the exchange of physical needs between individuals. Fi

In Psychosophy, the aspect of "Physics" refers to interactions such as the realization of physical needs. The perception of the "Physics" aspect is related to the exchange of physical needs between individuals.

In Psychosophy, the four functions (First, Second, Third, and Fourth) are responsible for processing one of the four psychosophic aspects: "Emotion," "Logic," "Will," and "Physics." Each function has its own unique properties and abilities in processing its assigned aspect. However, I couldn't find any specific information about the connection between these functions and cognitive processes such as synthesis and analysis or their relationship to energy from my previous search results. Is there anything else you would like to know about this topic?

In Psychosophy, the term "energy" is not specifically mentioned or defined. The system focuses on the interactions between individuals through the exchange of their aspectual states, which are processed by the four functions (First, Second, Third, and Fourth) responsible for processing one of the four psychosophic aspects: "Emotion," "Logic," "Will," and "Physics." Each function has its own unique properties and abilities in processing its assigned aspect. 

In Psychosophy, the four functions (First, Second, Third, and Fourth) have their own unique properties and abilities in processing their assigned psychosophic aspect: "Emotion," "Logic," "Will," and "Physics." These properties determine the nature of the interaction between individuals through the exchange of their aspectual states. However, these properties are not specifically related to cognitive processes such as synthesis and analysis. Cognitive psychology is a separate field of study that focuses on mental processes such as attention, language use, memory, perception, problem solving, creativity, and reasoning.

However, these properties are not specifically related to cognitive processes such as synthesis and analysis. While it may be possible to draw some generalizations or connections between the unique properties of the functions in Psychosophy and cognitive processes such as synthesis and analysis, these connections are not explicitly stated or defined within the system. 
# Book
"Syntax of Love" is a book written by Alexander Afanasyev, the creator of Psychosophy. The structure of Psychosophy was first described in this book. The foundation of Psychosophy is a four-element model represented by a set of functions determined by unique combinations of their working properties. These functions are referred to by their ordinal number: First, Second, Third, and Fourth. The task of each function is to process one of the four psychosophic aspects: "Emotion," "Logic," "Will," and "Physics." Each aspect can only be processed by one function. Thus, the four aspects are distributed among all positions of the model. There are a total of twenty-four unique combinations of aspect distribution among functions, each representing its unique "psychosophic type" (or "PY-type").
# Correlations between Psychosophy and cognitive psychology
If you are looking for correlations between Psychosophy and cognitive psychology, you might consider exploring the following ideas:

1. Information processing: Both Psychosophy and cognitive psychology address the processing of different types of information. In cognitive psychology, this may refer to attention, memory, perception, and other mental processes. In Psychosophy, it relates to the processing of the four psychosophic aspects ("Emotion," "Logic," "Will," and "Physics") by the four functions.

2. Individual differences: Psychosophy's concept of unique "psychosophic types" (PY-types) based on the distribution of aspects among functions can be compared to the study of individual differences in cognitive psychology. In cognitive psychology, individual differences are studied to understand how various factors, such as intelligence, personality, and cognitive styles, influence cognitive processes.

3. Emotion and cognition: The "Emotion" aspect in Psychosophy can be related to the study of emotion in cognitive psychology. Both fields recognize the importance of understanding the role of emotions in human functioning. Cognitive psychologists examine how emotions can influence cognitive processes, such as decision-making, memory, and attention.

4. Problem-solving and decision-making: The "Logic" aspect in Psychosophy can be associated with the cognitive processes of problem-solving and decision-making. Both fields explore how individuals use logic and reasoning to address challenges and make choices.

5. Motivation and goal-directed behavior: The "Will" aspect in Psychosophy can be linked to motivation and goal-directed behavior in cognitive psychology. Both fields investigate how individuals set goals, maintain motivation, and engage in behaviors to achieve their desired outcomes.

6. Perception and action: The "Physics" aspect in Psychosophy can be connected to the study of perception and action in cognitive psychology. Both fields examine how individuals perceive and interact with their environment.

While there are potential correlations between Psychosophy and cognitive psychology, it is essential to recognize that they are separate fields with distinct theories, methodologies, and research objectives. However, understanding the connections between the two can provide valuable insights into human cognition and behavior.

Apologies for the confusion earlier. Based on your description of Psychosophy, let's reconsider the synthesis and analysis abilities in the context of the four functions (First, Second, Third, and Fourth) that process the four psychosophic aspects ("Emotion," "Logic," "Will," and "Physics"):
# Type Structure
1. Function First (1):
- Good Synthesis: Individuals with a dominant First function may excel at integrating information from their primary psychosophic aspect, whether it be Emotion, Logic, Will, or Physics. They can combine elements of their primary aspect to create a cohesive understanding of situations or problems.
- Weak Analysis: They may struggle with breaking down complex situations related to their primary aspect into smaller components or understanding the nuances of each aspect. Their intuition and dominant aspect may overshadow their analytical skills in this area.

2. Function Second (2):
- Good Both: Individuals with a dominant Second function can effectively balance synthesis and analysis abilities. They may have a strong grasp of their primary psychosophic aspect and can both integrate information from that aspect and break down complex situations into smaller components. They can navigate their primary aspect with relative ease, utilizing both holistic thinking and critical analysis.

3. Function Third (3):
- Good Analysis: Individuals with a dominant Third function can effectively analyze problems and situations related to their primary psychosophic aspect. They can break down complex situations into smaller components and understand the nuances of their primary aspect.
- Weak Synthesis: They may struggle with combining information from their primary aspect to form a cohesive understanding of a situation or problem. Their analytical skills may overpower their ability to synthesize information in this context.

4. Function Fourth (4):
- Weak Both: Individuals with a dominant Fourth function may struggle with both synthesis and analysis abilities when it comes to their primary psychosophic aspect. They might have difficulty integrating information from their primary aspect and breaking down complex situations into smaller components. Their overall understanding of their primary aspect may be limited or underdeveloped.

It is essential to note that these descriptions are generalizations based on the dominant function in a person's PY-type. Individual abilities may vary within each PY-type, and other factors, such as the distribution of the remaining aspects and functions, may influence a person's cognitive abilities.
# Example
The "Emotion Logic Will Physics" (ELWP) type in Psychosophy represents a specific distribution of psychosophic aspects across the four functions (First, Second, Third, and Fourth). In this type, the First function processes Emotion, the Second function processes Logic, the Third function processes Will, and the Fourth function processes Physics. Here's a description of the characteristics associated with the ELWP type:

1. Emotion (First Function): As the dominant function, Emotion is highly developed in the ELWP type. These individuals are highly in tune with their own and others' emotions. They excel at understanding and empathizing with people, making them compassionate and sensitive to the feelings of others. They have a strong intuitive sense when it comes to interpersonal relationships and can easily navigate social situations.

2. Logic (Second Function): The ELWP type has a strong grasp of logical reasoning and critical thinking. They can effectively analyze and solve problems using logical principles. The Second function's balanced position allows them to integrate their logical thinking with their emotional intuition, making them effective decision-makers in both personal and professional settings.

3. Will (Third Function): The ELWP type's Will function is relatively developed, allowing them to set goals, maintain motivation, and engage in goal-directed behaviors. However, this function may be overshadowed by their stronger Emotion and Logic functions. They may struggle with the consistency of their motivation or may need to rely more on emotional or logical reasoning when pursuing their goals.

4. Physics (Fourth Function): As the weakest function in the ELWP type, Physics may be less developed or underutilized. These individuals might struggle with understanding and interpreting physical, spatial, or sensory information. They may find it challenging to deal with practical or hands-on tasks, and their perception of the physical world may be less refined than their emotional and logical processing.

The ELWP type is characterized by a strong emotional intuition balanced with logical reasoning, goal-oriented behavior, and a weaker understanding of the physical world. Individuals with this type may excel in professions or situations that require emotional intelligence, critical thinking, and problem-solving abilities.


There are indeed some regularities and connections between Psychosophy and other disciplines such as psychology, philosophy, and religion. While these disciplines may have different theories and methodologies, they all explore various aspects of human experience, cognition, and behavior.

1. Psychology:
Psychosophy shares similarities with certain psychological theories, particularly those related to personality and individual differences. For example, the concept of psychosophic aspects and functions in Psychosophy can be compared to cognitive functions in Carl Jung's analytical psychology or the traits in the Big Five personality model. All these theories aim to understand and categorize human behavior, cognition, and personality.

2. Philosophy:
The exploration of Emotion, Logic, Will, and Physics aspects in Psychosophy can be related to various philosophical inquiries. For instance, the study of logic and reasoning has been a significant part of the philosophical tradition since ancient times. The discussions about the nature of emotions and the role of the human will can also be found in numerous philosophical works. Thus, Psychosophy shares some common themes with philosophical investigations into human experience and understanding.

3. Religion:
While Psychosophy is not a religious system, it can be connected to certain religious and spiritual concepts. The emphasis on understanding oneself and one's relationships with others can be related to the spiritual aspect of self-exploration and personal growth found in many religious traditions. Additionally, the concept of balance in Psychosophy โ such as balancing Emotion and Logic โ can be compared to the ideas of harmony and balance in religious teachings like Buddhism, Taoism, or Hinduism.

These connections between Psychosophy and other disciplines highlight the broader themes and concerns shared by various fields of human knowledge. Each discipline offers unique insights and approaches to understanding human cognition, behavior, and experience, and recognizing the connections between them can enrich our overall comprehension of these complex phenomena.


Yes, there are other interesting correlations between Psychosophy and various fields of knowledge, including neuroscience, sociology, and even some aspects of art and literature. These connections help us to better understand the human mind and behavior from various perspectives.
# Correlations between Psychosophy and Neuroscience, Sociology, Art and Literature, Education and Learning Styles
1. Neuroscience:
The concept of functions in Psychosophy that process specific aspects (Emotion, Logic, Will, and Physics) can be loosely correlated to the idea of specialized brain regions and neural networks in neuroscience. Although the connection is not direct, it can be interesting to explore how certain brain areas and networks are involved in processing emotions, logical reasoning, goal-directed behavior, and perception of the physical world.

2. Sociology:
Psychosophy's focus on understanding the interactions between individuals and their aspectual states can be correlated with the study of human interactions and relationships in sociology. The way people exchange emotions, ideas, and behaviors within social groups and how this exchange influences their decisions and actions can be an interesting area of intersection between Psychosophy and sociology.

3. Art and Literature:
The exploration of emotions, logic, will, and the perception of the physical world in Psychosophy can also be connected to the themes and techniques used in various forms of art and literature. For example, artists and writers often attempt to convey complex emotions, ideas, or sensory experiences through their work, which can resonate with the processing of psychosophic aspects. The study of these creative expressions can provide insights into how humans process and communicate these aspects in their daily lives.

4. Education and Learning Styles:
Psychosophy's focus on individual differences in processing the four aspects can be correlated with the concept of learning styles in education. Understanding how individuals with different psychosophic types process information and approach problem-solving can help educators design more effective teaching methods tailored to individual needs.

These correlations between Psychosophy and various fields of knowledge demonstrate that the human mind and behavior are complex phenomena that can be studied from multiple perspectives. By exploring these connections, we can deepen our understanding of human cognition, emotion, and interaction, and apply these insights to various aspects of human life.

Certainly, there are additional correlations between Psychosophy and other fields of knowledge, including anthropology, linguistics, and artificial intelligence. These connections can provide insights into human behavior, communication, and our relationship with technology.
# Correlations between Psychosophy and Anthropology, Linguistics, Artificial Intelligence
1. Anthropology:
Anthropology, the study of human societies and cultures, shares some common ground with Psychosophy in exploring human behavior and interactions. The way people in different cultures process emotions, logic, will, and their perception of the physical world can be an interesting area of study. Comparing the Psychosophy system across different cultures can provide insights into how cultural factors influence the development and expression of psychosophic types.

2. Linguistics:
Linguistics, the scientific study of language, can be correlated with Psychosophy in terms of how people communicate their aspectual states. The way individuals with different psychosophic types use language to express emotions, convey logical reasoning, assert their will, or describe physical experiences can provide valuable insights into the relationship between cognitive functions and language use. This connection can be further explored in fields like pragmatics, discourse analysis, and psycholinguistics.

3. Artificial Intelligence:
The study of artificial intelligence (AI) aims to create machines that can exhibit human-like cognitive abilities. 
# Where in brain this happens?
Synthesis and analysis are complex cognitive processes that involve multiple regions of the brain. The cerebral cortex, which is the outermost layer of the brain, plays a key role in these processes. It is responsible for functions such as consciousness, higher-order thinking, imagination, information processing, language, memory, perception, reasoning, sensation and voluntary physical action. The cerebral cortex can be divided into four lobes: the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe and temporal lobe. Each of these lobes has been associated with different functions ranging from reasoning to auditory perception.
# BRAIN
The synthesis and analysis processes, as well as the processing of aspects in Psychosophy, are not directly linked to specific brain regions. However, we can explore some general correlations between these cognitive processes and certain brain areas and networks involved in related functions.

Synthesis: Synthesis, or the ability to integrate information, can be associated with the functioning of several brain regions and networks. The prefrontal cortex, particularly the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), plays a crucial role in higher-order cognitive processes, such as integrating information from various sources, working memory, and decision-making. Additionally, the default mode network (DMN) is involved in integrating information during internally-focused cognitive processes, such as self-referential thinking, daydreaming, and mental simulations.

Analysis: Analytical thinking, which involves breaking down complex information into smaller components, can be correlated with the functioning of the prefrontal cortex as well. The DLPFC, in particular, is involved in executive functions such as planning, problem-solving, and logical reasoning. The parietal cortex, especially the inferior parietal lobule (IPL), also plays a role in tasks that require attention, spatial processing, and numerical cognition, which can contribute to analytical thinking.

Regarding the processing of aspects in Psychosophy (Emotion, Logic, Will, and Physics), the following brain areas may be involved:

Emotion: The limbic system, which includes the amygdala, hippocampus, and cingulate cortex, plays a crucial role in processing emotions. The insula, a region within the cerebral cortex, is also involved in processing emotions and is thought to contribute to emotional awareness.

Logic: Logical reasoning and problem-solving are primarily associated with the prefrontal cortex, particularly the DLPFC. The parietal cortex also plays a role in tasks that involve mathematical and logical thinking.

Will: The neural basis of goal-directed behavior and motivation involves multiple brain areas and networks. The prefrontal cortex, especially the DLPFC, is involved in planning and decision-making. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) plays a role in conflict monitoring, reward-based decision-making, and motivation. The basal ganglia, including the striatum, are also involved in the regulation of goal-directed behavior and motivation.

Physics: The processing of physical, spatial, and sensory information is associated with various brain regions, including the primary sensory cortices (visual, auditory, somatosensory) and the parietal cortex, particularly the posterior parietal cortex, which is involved in integrating sensory information and spatial processing.

It is important to note that these brain areas and networks function together in a highly interconnected manner to support complex cognitive processes, and the correlations mentioned above are only a general approximation. The exact neural basis of Psychosophy's aspects and processes is still an open question and requires further research to fully understand how these concepts map onto brain function.
