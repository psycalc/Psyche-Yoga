## The difference between Psychosophy and Temporistics

People familiar with A.Yu. Afanasyev's Psychosophy (Psychoyoga) will see that the functions of Psychosophy and the aspects of Temporistics are mostly similar to each other. This is not a coincidence, as mentioned earlier, Temporistics itself was born from the combination of A. Afanasyev's model with time categories. It is possible that Afanasyev's model, in which the first function is expressed excessively, the second normatively, the third inadequately, and the fourth insignificantly, is quite universal. It is possible that much in human psychology and behavior can be described by similar "tetrads" (foursomes). The possibility of further study and application of the model discovered by A.Yu. Afanasyev seems infinitely interesting and promising unexpected perspectives. However, when studying Temporistics, it should be remembered that aspects of perception (vision) in their manifestation differ somewhat from the functions of Psychosophy, although they have many common features.

### What differences can be mentioned?

#### Space-Time

Psychosophy functions affect space, Physics, Logic, Will and Emotion - these are direct "horizontal" ways for a person to influence the world. While Temporistics aspects talk about time. Past, Future, Present and Eternity - these are ways for a person to penetrate "vertical reality".

For example, a programmer using Psychosophy might focus on improving their skills in a specific programming language (space), while a programmer using Temporistics might focus on how their work will impact the future of technology (time).

#### Connections between different functions

The connection between Physics, Logic, Will and Emotions is weak, that is, the relationship between Physics and Logic or Will and Emotions is not structured or not obviously structured.
