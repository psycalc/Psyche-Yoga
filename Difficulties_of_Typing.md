## Difficulties of Typing

Typing is the process of determining a person's type according to a particular system of personality typology. There can be difficulties in typing because people are complex and multifaceted. A person's behavior can be influenced by many factors such as their upbringing, personal experiences, and social norms. This can make it difficult to accurately determine their type.

Typing can also be complicated by the fact that people may behave differently in different situations or may try to hide their true nature. Additionally, some people may have traits that are associated with multiple types, making it difficult to determine their dominant type.

To accurately determine a person's type, it is important to analyze not only what they do but also why they do it. It is also important to consider their personal experiences and the context in which they are behaving.

## Challenges of Creating a Universal Algorithm of Compatibility

Creating a universal algorithm of compatibility between two people on earth is a complex and challenging task. People are unique individuals with their own personalities, experiences, and backgrounds. These factors can influence their compatibility with others in different ways.

Additionally, compatibility is not just about shared interests or similar personalities. It also involves factors such as communication styles, values, and goals. These can vary greatly between individuals and can be difficult to accurately measure and predict.

One approach to addressing this challenge is to categorize the most fundamental cognitive functions on which values and behaviors are mostly based. By understanding these underlying cognitive functions, it may be possible to better predict compatibility between individuals.

However, due to the complexity and variability of human relationships, it is unlikely that a single algorithm could accurately predict compatibility between any two people on earth.
